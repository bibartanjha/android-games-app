# Summary of app
In this app, I coded a variety of games using Android Jetpack Compose. Each game is structured in a MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel format). 

### App main-menu screen

Upon clicking on each icon, you will be led to the respective game. This navigation was done using `rememberNavController` from the androidx.navigation.compose library. You can see the navigation code here: https://github.com/bibartanjha/android-games-app/tree/main/app/src/main/java/com/example/android_games_app/navigation
